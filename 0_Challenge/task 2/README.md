# Challenge 2 - FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a common coding challenge for technical interviews, so this is your chance to show off to potential employers that you value job security over all else.

A brief description of the challenge: `Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to n. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".`
