# HackSoc Bad Codeathon Challenge

## Languages

We still have to be able to judge your code, so languages you can use are restricted to C-style languages (C, Java, JavaScript, Rust etc) or Python. If you're unsure, just ask someone and they'll let you know if you can use it or not.

## Rules

* All code must be your own
* All code must be able to reasonably run on a Ubuntu system without any compiler modifications or additional libraries
